# Prerequisites:

Node: https://nodejs.org/en

MySQL server: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

MySQL workbench (other alternatives exist but this is the one I (Jason) used): https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/

Tutorial for MySQL installation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u96rVINbAUI

# Install packages (see package.json for reference)

```npm install```

# See if you have the packages installed:

```npm list```

# You might need these VS code extensions for everything to work smoothly:

-Live Saas Compiler 

-HTML CSS Support

For live Saas Compiler, you will want to change the output css file to go to the public directory:

# To run the server:

Note: Import the database and set your password in app.js before starting the server: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cbm5vPQvNI 
You can also simply copy and paste the code from tuffyasks.sql and run it directly in workbench as well

```npm run devStart ``` 

Access website with the following URL (directed to login for now): http://localhost:3000/login
